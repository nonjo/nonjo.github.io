  <h1>Agenda</h1>
  <p>Agenda is a productivity app that boasts a distinctive visual style that is hard to ignore. It&rsquo;s effectively a note-taking app, of which there are many for both the Mac and iOS, but some core features distinguish it from this crowded field.</p>

<p>De riguer for a note-taking app on iOS is Markdown support</p>

<p>The core features in Agenda are free to use; you can create projects and notes within them, apply a considerable number of formatting options, and (most generously) sync between iOS and Mac devices. Additional features will require a one-year subscription, which you can buy in iOS, Mac, or iOS+Mac flavors. Using the sub grants you access to additional line height formatting, auto dark mode, and the ability to create calendar events, among others.</p>

<h2 id="integration-with-the-ecosystem">Integration with the Ecosystem</h2>

<p>Increasingly, I look for Drafts integration in any iOS application I purchase or use, and happily Agenda has been considered.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s not enough for Agenda to be a good text editor; those exist in plenty, from iA Writer to Bear. Agenda adds value by connecting to your calendar. For example, if you have a staff meeting on Wednesday at 9 PM, you can create an ahem, agenda, for the meeting and link the note to the calendar entry. This places the note up front and center in the application on the day of the meeting, _and provides an Agneda URL in Apple&rsquo;s stock calendar app, _ DOES IT?</p>

<p>Agenda still requires considerable work up front (to create notes prior to agenda items).</p>

<p>One of Agenda&rsquo;s coolest power features is it&rsquo;s agenda:// URL feature. You can grab a URL for any note in Agenda, which then allows you to link to the note from another app. For example, if you use a project or note as support for an OmniFocus project or task, you can link to the Agenda note or project. One use that I intuitied today was to put a URL in a collection in DevonTHINK with other disparate pieces of data. I have links to TaskPaper files, archived PDFs, and other support materials in DevonTHINK; I created a link in the same collection and pasted in the Agenda link. This cements for me DevonTHINK&rsquo;s ability to serve as a hub for everything I do, but apps like Agenda to play an important role.</p>

<h2 id="i-used-agenda-to-plan-out-a-family-vacation">I used Agenda to plan out a family vacation.</h2>

<p>Agenda is in many ways the opposite of something like BBEdit or TaskPaper; as many new note-taking apps offer a text-centric, elemental approach to writing, Agenda offers inline attachment support and</p>

<p>I was able to attach PDF files of our itinerary, for example; I found myself creating folders in Files, and saving the PDFs out of Airmail to the folder, which I attached to the corresponding Agenda note. This is a lot of steps but still excellent. What&rsquo;s more, I had originally dropped the vacation file folder on the desktop of my Files installation (I&rsquo;m an old school mac user and that will never die), but moving it to a sub folder in my documents folder in iCloud never cause the link in Agenda to break,</p>

<h2 id="can-you-gtd-with-agenda">Can you GTD with Agenda?</h2>

<p>Agenda helps you Get Things Done, but you can&rsquo;t implement GTD in the same way that you might expect if you&rsquo;re coming applications like OmniFocus and Things. For example, there is tag support, such that you can tag lines inside of notes with @tags like @phone or @email. Agenda separates such information or context tags from people tags, which have a different icon.</p>

<p>Both tags are potentially helpful, as you can search on tag instances in Agenda. However, searches show the whole note in which the tag appears, rather than the line, for example (as you might see in TaskPaper). If you&rsquo;re looking to get a list of phone calls you need to make, for example, Agenda isn&rsquo;t very helpful. It&rsquo;s more project focused than context focused, which is contrary to how GTD is organized.</p>

<p>Other limitations include there being no filter or archive for projects (or notes) that are done or archived. You have to create a scratch category and drop archived items there (the developers report that they are working on this).</p>

<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s the organizational scheme of Agenda that bothers me the most relative to what the terms mean in GTD. Categories and projects are fine, but it requires you to create an inbox or misc project for other notes.</p>
