I've been using notes for handwriting input on my iPad Pro and I have to say, the simplicity and sheer functionality of the app is refreshing. I have been cracking it open for little notes here and there, even using it on my mac with typed content. I like that I can search on even handwritten input. And it's automatic table support coming out of rendered html and excel/sheets is crazy helpful.
