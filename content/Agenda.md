Agenda is a productivity app that boasts a distinctive visual style that is hard to ignore. It's effectively a note-taking app, of which there are many for both the Mac and iOS, but some core features distinguish it from this crowded field.

<!--more-->



The core features in Agenda are free to use; you can create projects and notes within them, apply a considerable number of formatting options, and (most generously) sync between iOS and Mac devices. Additional features will require a one-year subscription, which you can buy in iOS, Mac, or iOS+Mac flavors. Using the sub grants you access to additional line height formatting, auto dark mode, and the ability to create calendar events, among others.

## The Hierarchy, Spread Out on A Nightstand

Agenda organizes its core component–the note–into any number of projects. Project can be assigned to categories. Consider my current setup:

You could have one categorie with many projects, or even one cateogry with one project into which you pile all of your notes.

The next consideration–and perhaps the reason for considering Agenda in the first place–is its feature whereby notes are assigned to a calendar event. Let's say you have a meeting iwth your supervisor to discuss progress on a specific project. You can, from the note itself, see a list of calendar items, and then link the note to the event. This will add a link to the event in Calendar, which you can use to quickly navigate from Calendar to the note in Agenda (this doesn't work with Fantastical).

Agenda also offers a few overview screens, which allow you to see which notes are attached to events today, or which are "on the agenda" (meaning you've flagged them for your attention. Using "on the agenda" requires a little fiddling on the users' part; you have to essentially flag and unflag notes to have the appear in this collection.

## Text Styling

De riguer for a note-taking app on iOS is Markdown support 

Text can be easily styled into multiple levels of headings and body text. You can specify these using menu items, contextual menu items, or keystrokes. You can also use Markdown's "# heading" convention to create multiple levels of headings. 

## Integration with the Ecosystem

Increasingly, I look for Drafts integration in any iOS application I purchase or use, and happily Agenda has been considered.

Ultimately, it's not enough for Agenda to be a good text editor; those exist in plenty, from iA Writer to Bear. Agenda adds value by connecting to your calendar. For example, if you have a staff meeting on Wednesday at 9 PM, you can create an ahem, agenda, for the meeting and link the note to the calendar entry. This places the note up front and center in the application on the day of the meeting, _and provides an Agneda URL in Apple's stock calendar app, _ DOES IT?

Agenda still requires considerable work up front (to create notes prior to agenda items).

One of Agenda's coolest power features is it's agenda:// URL feature. You can grab a URL for any note in Agenda, which then allows you to link to the note from another app. For example, if you use a project or note as support for an OmniFocus project or task, you can link to the Agenda note or project. One use that I intuitied today was to put a URL in a collection in DevonTHINK with other disparate pieces of data. I have links to TaskPaper files, archived PDFs, and other support materials in DevonTHINK; I created a link in the same collection and pasted in the Agenda link. This cements for me DevonTHINK's ability to serve as a hub for everything I do, but apps like Agenda to play an important role.

## My Own Private Test Case

Agenda is in many ways the opposite of something like BBEdit or TaskPaper; as many new note-taking apps offer a text-centric, elemental approach to writing, Agenda offers inline attachment support and rich formatting options, resulting in a rich visual experience. I used it to plan a short getaway this spring for the family to see how it might fit into my life.

I was able to attach PDF files of our itinerary, for example; I found myself creating folders in Files, and saving the PDFs out of Airmail to the folder, which I then attached to the corresponding Agenda note. In true Macintosh style, I had originally dropped the vacation file folder on the desktop of my Files installation (I'm an old school Mac user and that will never die), but moving it to a sub folder in my documents folder in iCloud never cause the link in Agenda to break. I organized each location of the trip (Rehoboth Beach, DE; Annapolis, MD; and Baltimore, MD) as a separate note in Agenda, and attached the required itinerary to each note.

Pre-trip, I created a packing list and used the checkbox feature 

## Can you GTD with Agenda?

Agenda helps you Get Things Done, but you can't implement GTD in the same way that you might expect if you're coming applications like OmniFocus and Things. For example, there is tag support, such that you can tag lines inside of notes with @tags like @phone or @email. Agenda separates such information or context tags from people tags, which have a different icon.

Both tags are potentially helpful, as you can search on tag instances in Agenda. However, searches show the whole note in which the tag appears, rather than the line, for example (as you might see in TaskPaper). If you're looking to get a list of phone calls you need to make, for example, Agenda isn't very helpful. It's more project-focused than context-focused, which is contrary to how GTD is organized.

Other limitations include there being no filter or archive for projects (or notes) that are done or archived. You have to create a scratch category and drop archived items there (the developers report that they are working on this).

In fact, it's the organizational scheme of Agenda that bothers me the most relative to what the terms mean in GTD. Categories and projects are fine, but it requires you to create an inbox or misc project for other notes.
	
## Misc

Agenda has a handful of uself–and ulimately endearing–features that make it a joy to use:

- 	collapse notes: Agenda allows you to collapse notes withing a project, providing a kind of list or flat outline of the scope and sequence of your project.
